The images for the JOSM SeaMap styles are generated by invoking: ./make_images in a bash shell terminal window from this directory.
On a Windows PC, this will require the installation of Cygwin. All platforms (Windows-Cygwin, Mac-OS, Linux) require that
Inkscape has been installed, and its command-line invokation is on the user's PATH.

Running make_images will overwrite existing images of the same name, but will leave all others untouched. If an image file becomes
obsolete, it must be deleted manually. This allows for images unique to the JOSM SeaMap styles to co-exist in the directory.
